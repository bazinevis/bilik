#+title: Dart Comments

Syntactically, Dart incorporates two types of comments:
+ single line comments:
  Comments beginning with '//' and extending to the new line character are
  considered single-line comments in Dart.
  #+begin_src dart
    void main() {
      // This will print the given statement on screen
      print("Welcome to JavaTpoint");
    }
  #+end_src

+ Multi-line Comments:
  Comments beginning with ',/*' and extending across multiple lines until the
  corresponding '*/' are considered multi-line comments in Dart.
  #+begin_src dart
    /* This is the example of multi-line comment
    This will print the given statement on screen */
    void main() {
      print("Welcome to JavaTpoint");
    }
  #+end_src

Dart also includes a tool called [[file:./_dart_doc.org]['dart doc']] that generates documents from
extracted comments in the source code. This tool expects programmers to adhere
to specific comment styles and rules when annotating parts of the source code.
