* PART I: LET THERE BE DART
** CHAPTER ONE: WORLD BEFORE DART WAS BORN
# what problems were in the technology before dart
# no naming dart in this chapter
# dart comes to answer javascript's shortcomings

** CHAPTER TWO: ONCE UPON A TIME, DART
# why someone ends up with dart
# a little bit of history
# Dart wants to target everything
# dart first want to target web but now everything
# dart design principles
# how dart executes a program
# overview of the whole Dart language
# aot compiler vs jit compiler
# dart cons and pros
# dart future
# dart is known by flutter framework
# what sb should want to end up with dart? dart answer to what questions
# how dart render gui and use native API

** CHAPTER THREE: FIRST THINGS FIRST
# setting up multiple IDEs
# simplest possible program in dart
# how to debug
# how to trace
# Setting things up
# Hello Dart!


* PART II: LEARNING TO PLAY DART
** CHAPTER FOUR: HOW DART DESIGNED
# why dart desiged this way
# what trade offs considered in dart
# syntactic sugars
# everything is object
# type safety
# type insurance?
# object oriented design of dart
# everthing is object in dart even functions
# functional programming in dart
# dart's grammar is C like
# comments
# a little bit survey about grammar and syntax sugar

** Chapter FIVE: REPRESENTING & OPERATING ON DATA
# everything is an object
# classes
# creating objects
# default constructor
# inheritance
# extends keyword
# super keyword
# polymorphism
# static polymorphism
# dynamic polymorphism
# encapsulation
# abstract classes and methods
# interfaces
# callable classes
# accessors
# getters and setters
# noSuchMethod
# constant objects and fields
# metaclass
# finals
# identity and equality
# defining variables
# constants & finals?
# var
# operators
# operators precedence
# spread operator
# collection, lists, etc
