#+subtitle: BEFORE SHOOTING ANY DARTS

#+begin_comment
# in this chapter overview of dart programming language will be told.
# how dart desiged and why it is desiged this way. these explanations will
# be told to a person who has a enough understanding of object oriented
# programming and programming concepts overall. there shouldn't be any
# syntax here. just naming concepts names and if possible their cards from
# other books or notes. just saying concepts. for example we will tell about
# grammar is C like and everything is object even functions and null even
# premitive data types. we will tell about referenceing and variables and
# how dart store data and strings and numbers and how it operates on them.
# how dart type safety works and how type conversion works in dart.
# after explaining fundamentals
# we go to flow control and will tell flow control statements.
# in this chapter we tell fundamentals and in the next chapters we try
# to expand these concepts further more.
# why dart desiged this way
# what trade offs considered in dart
# syntactic sugars
# type safety
# type insurance?
# object oriented design of dart
# functional programming in dart
# dart's grammar is C like
# comments
# a little bit survey about grammar and syntax sugar

- dart design principles
- dart is pure object oriented language
- everything is object
- scope
- C like language
- comments
- functional capabilities
- syntax sugar
- type safety
- overall structure of dart program
- everything program related not execute related
