The use-package macro allows you to set up package customization in your init
file in a declarative way. It takes care of many things for you that would
otherwise require a lot of repetitive boilerplate code. It can help with common
customization, such as binding keys, setting up hooks, customizing user options
and faces, autoloading, and more. It also helps you keep Emacs startup fast,
even when you use many (even hundreds) of packages.

Note that use-package is not a package manager. Although use-package does have
the useful capability to interface with the Emacs package manager, its primary
purpose is help with the configuration and loading of packages, not with
managing their download, upgrades, and installation.
