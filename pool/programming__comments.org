Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as
well have been written by someone else.

In programming, comments are essential for improving code comprehension. Across
various programming languages, comments serve as guides, helping to bridge the
gap between the technical language of code and human understanding. While code
should ideally be clear on its own, comments provide additional explanations and
context, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the code,
thereby facilitating maintenance and troubleshooting. Furthermore, it's
important to note that comments are eliminated before compilation and therefore
do not impact runtime performance, ensuring that the execution of the code
remains unaffected.

Comments can effectively document code, sometimes eliminating the need for
additional means to describe its functionality. With proper usage, code
documentation can be achieved solely through comments. Additionally, there are
tools available that can extract comments from source code and generate a
compact, formatted document. These tools often require comments to be written in
specific formats and can create links to various parts of code elements, thereby
facilitating easier code comprehension.

Comments in programming languages come in two forms: single-line and multiline
(or block) comments. Each language utilizes special symbols to denote the
beginning and end of comments. Single-line comments typically start with the
special symbol and extend to the end of the line. On the other hand, multiline
comments begin with a specific symbol and conclude with its corresponding ending
symbol. The rules governing comment syntax are defined by the grammar of each
programming language.

It is widely accepted that block comments are employed to document large
sections of code, such as files or classes. Conversely, single-line comments are
brief and are typically placed before or alongside code that lacks
self-explanation. Importantly, it's worth noting that several consecutive
single-line comments can be used to convey a block-like comment within the code.
