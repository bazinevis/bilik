+ I want the book and site has a consistent art style. Art in displaying images
  and graphs and logo.
+ The goal is after reading this book, reader can without any help (except this
  book) and without looking on any code, begin to write code. This book is
  comprehensive and in detail.
+ Every text node has some prerequisites and every text node can be a
  prerequisite to another text node.
+ Every text node has number of read and passed tag.
+ (application/web) & book
+ In the application & web I should show what are the prerequisites of current
  text node and how many times they were read and are they passed or not.
+ Every book or website article is made of text nodes with some text added to
  the beginning and end of it. Text nodes are important. Text nodes sould be
  generic to be fit in the books and articles.
+ Every time I read about one aspect of dart language, I can update concepts and
  dart documents and little by little the whole document will be created.
